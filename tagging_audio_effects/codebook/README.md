This codebook contains the list of sound effects which are currently tagged by the model. For now, this codebook 
contains the same 521 audio effect classes present in the [YaMNet](https://github.com/tensorflow/models/blob/master/research/audioset/yamnet/yamnet_class_map.csv).
Later when transfer learning will be done, the list of the classes will be fine-tuned to match RedHen's requirements. 

## Format
The data is present in csv contains an index field and the corresponding sound effects description. 
This list will be updated in RedHen's website in future.
