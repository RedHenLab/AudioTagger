# Gsoc2022
In GSoc 2022, I will be working with [Redhen Labs](https://www.redhenlab.org/summer-of-code/red-hen-lab-gsoc-2022-projects). 

The objective is to develop a machine learning model to tag sound effects in streams (like police sirens in a news-stream) of Red Hen’s data. A single stream of data can contain multiple sound effects, so the model should be able to label them from a group of known sound effects like a Multi-label classification problem. The first step would be to develop a baseline model using existing pre-trained deep learning models and add to the Red Hen’s pipeline. Then the performance can be improved using transfer learning and fine tuning the existing model to achieve better accuracy. In this process, the models can be trained on sound effects from noisy or human labeled data sets after they are pre-processed to avoid acoustic domain mismatch problems.
